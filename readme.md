Dotfiles
========

This is my dotfiles repository. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This repository isn't suitable for public use *as is*, but, as usual with these things, you may find useful snippets of code in it that you can repurpose to suit your own needs.


Installation
------------

    $ git clone https://github.com/dmulholland/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && source ~/.dotfiles/init.sh

The installation can be reinitialized at any time using the `dotfiles` command.
